Eyes Animator is component which will animate eye spheres to behave like real or to behave more cartoon like, it's up to you!

Eye movement is a small detail thing, but when it suddenly appear in your project, you can feel that it was truly missing.
Component have intuitive settings which you can use to design your custom movement for eyes.
Animation is procedural and constatly random - no repetitions, it's only using game object's rotation.

Algorithm is simulating eyes point of interest lag for more realism, which effect you can adjust with simple slider.
There is also random eyes movement simulation, with different presets: 
From calm through nervous to psychical cues - movement of eyes when someone is lying / trying to remember sound etc.

All you need to have are eyes sphere models or eye bones in your 3D model.

Main features:
-Includes interactive demo scenes
-Includes full source code with detailed commentary

- Quickly setup component with custom inspector
- Easily change target objects to follow by eyes
- Blend eye animation and effects you apply in component
